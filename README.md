## Framework: NIST CSF 2.0
NovaCore is leveraging the five core functions defined in the NIST CSF:

- **GOVERN**
- **IDENTIFY**
- **PROTECT**
- **DETECT**
- **RESPOND**
- **RECOVER**

Each phase of implementation includes assessments, controls, gap identification, and continuous improvement actions.
