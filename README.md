# NovaCore Technologies <br> Cybersecurity Governance & Risk Framework

Welcome to NovaCore Technologies' cybersecurity initiative, structured around the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**. This repository documents our implementation journey and continuous improvement process.

## About NovaCore
NovaCore Technologies is a FinTech company that provides cloud-based financial services to enterprise clients. Our infrastructure supports sensitive transaction data, customer PII, and compliance-bound information.

## Project Objective
To assess, align, and mature NovaCore's cybersecurity posture using the NIST CSF 2.0 framework, focusing on governance, risk management, detection and response capabilities.

## Framework: NIST CSF 2.0
NovaCore is leveraging the five core functions defined in the NIST CSF:

- **GOVERN**
- **IDENTIFY**
- **PROTECT**
- **DETECT**
- **RESPOND**
- **RECOVER**

Each phase of implementation includes assessments, controls, gap identification, and continuous improvement actions.

## Visual Summaries
The following diagrams support NovaCore's NIST CSF implementation. These visuals are referenced throughout the supporting documentation files:

### Tier Matrix – Current vs Target Maturity
Illustrates NovaCore’s current and desired NIST CSF maturity levels across all six core functions.

### Risk Heatmap – Likelihood vs Impact
Maps identified cybersecurity risks (e.g., untrained staff, missing DLP) across a visual likelihood/impact grid for prioritization.
