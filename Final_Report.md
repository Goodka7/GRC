# Final Cybersecurity Report – NovaCore Technologies

**Prepared for:** NovaCore Executive Leadership  
**Prepared by:** Cybersecurity Governance Team  
**Date:** March 2025

## Executive Summary

NovaCore Technologies recently completed a review of its cybersecurity practices using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. The purpose of this project was to understand how well the company is protecting its data and systems, identify any weak areas, and create a clear plan for improvement.

We found that while NovaCore is doing well in areas like user account protection and basic monitoring, there are serious gaps in areas like data security, employee training, and vendor oversight. We've created a simple action plan that focuses on the biggest risks and shows what improvements should be made first.

## Where We Stand Today

We looked at six main areas of cybersecurity and gave each one a rating from 1 (very early) to 4 (very strong). Here's a visual summary:

</div>

**Quick Notes:**
- Some areas like governance (how security decisions are made) and recovery (how fast we can bounce back after an incident) are at the lowest level.
- Other areas like protection and monitoring are getting better but still need work.
- We aim to move all areas to a stronger and more consistent level over time.

## Biggest Risks We Found

We looked at the chances of bad things happening and how much damage they could cause. Then we made this heatmap to show the top risks:

</div>

**Top Concerns:**
- Employees aren’t trained enough to spot threats
- There's no system to prevent sensitive data from being sent out accidentally
- Some vendors have access to our systems, but we’re not checking on their security
- We haven’t practiced how to respond to a cyberattack

## How Our Systems Are Set Up

We created a simple diagram to show how data flows through our systems and where we’ve added protection:

</div>

**What This Shows:**
- Users log in to our systems using secure sign-in methods (MFA)
- We’ve added tools that help prevent data loss and detect threats
- Our main systems like GitHub, HR tools, and databases are all being monitored

## How We’ll Measure Progress

To make sure we're getting better, we'll track the following key numbers:

</div>

**Key Numbers to Watch:**
- How quickly we spot issues (5 hours on average)
- How fast we fix them (12 hours on average)
- How many systems are fully updated (95%)
- How many employees have completed training (87%)

## What We Recommend

To support the roadmap, here’s a high-level visual overview of how improvements will be rolled out across people, process, and technology:

</div>

Here’s what we need to do next:
- Set up a security leadership group
- Add better tools to prevent data loss and monitor systems
- Improve how we manage third-party vendors
- Run practice drills for cyberattacks
- Launch fun and effective training programs for staff

We’ll roll this out in three phases, starting in the next quarter (Q2 2025).

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

</div>

In addition to risk reduction, NovaCore must ensure it meets all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Many of the improvements outlined in this report also support compliance efforts across major standards:

- **GDPR and CCPA** for data privacy
- **SOX** and **GLBA** for financial and consumer data protection
- **ISO 27001** as a benchmark for overall security practices

The following cybersecurity controls help fulfill these obligations:
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) aligns with data privacy regulations
- Incident response planning supports legal breach notification requirements
- Vendor management ensures contractual compliance with third-party standards
- Regular training and logging support audit readiness

## Final Thoughts

By following this plan, NovaCore will become much more secure, able to handle cyber threats better, keep in compliance and build stronger trust with its customers. We’re committed to making cybersecurity a key part of our business success.
