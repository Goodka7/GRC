# Gap Analysis & Tier Assessment – NovaCore Technologies

## Tier Ratings Overview

The following table outlines NovaCore’s current and desired cybersecurity maturity tiers based on the NIST CSF 2.0. This is visually summarized in the Tier Matrix below.

| Core Function | Current Tier | Target Tier | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| GOVERN        | Tier 1 (Partial) | Tier 3 (Consistent) | Governance is ad hoc with no formal board ownership. |
| IDENTIFY      | Tier 2 (Risk Informed) | Tier 3 (Consistent) | Asset inventory needs completeness and classification. |
| PROTECT       | Tier 2 (Risk Informed) | Tier 4 (Adaptive) | IAM is strong but data loss prevention and training are lacking. |
| DETECT        | Tier 2 (Risk Informed) | Tier 4 (Adaptive) | Monitoring is focused but needs broader coverage. |
| RESPOND       | Tier 1 (Partial) | Tier 3 (Consistent) | No drills or structured incident plans. |
| RECOVER       | Tier 1 (Partial) | Tier 3 (Consistent) | No tested recovery plans or scheduled reviews. |

## Key Gaps Identified

### Governance
- No defined cybersecurity governance board
- Risk tolerance not documented or communicated

### Technical Controls
- No DLP or endpoint visibility solution
- Logging not extended to third parties or mobile endpoints

### Awareness & Culture
- No security champions or awareness ambassadors
- Annual training lacks interactivity and testing

### Incident Response
- No red/blue team testing
- Lack of chain-of-command and crisis communication plan

### Recovery
- No DR/BCP plan tested or approved
- No metric tracking for recovery readiness

## Risk-Based Prioritization Matrix

The following heatmap visualizes the severity of NovaCore's top cybersecurity gaps based on likelihood and impact.

| Gap | Risk Impact | Likelihood | Priority |
|-----|-------------|------------|----------|
| No DLP in place | High | Medium | High |
| Untrained staff | High | High | Critical |
| No IR testing | Medium | High | High |
| Poor 3rd-party oversight | High | Medium | High |
| Lack of governance structure | Medium | Low | Medium |
