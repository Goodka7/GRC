# Compliance and Legal Considerations – NovaCore Technologies

## Overview

Compliance plays a critical role in NovaCore’s cybersecurity planning. While risk management and governance guide internal priorities, regulatory compliance ensures the company adheres to industry expectations and legal obligations.

This page outlines:
- Relevant compliance requirements
- How NovaCore’s current and planned controls support them
- Next steps for embedding compliance in ongoing operations

---

## Relevant Compliance Standards

NovaCore’s services and data handling practices intersect with several major regulatory frameworks:

- **GDPR** – Protection of EU personal data
- **CCPA/CPRA** – California consumer privacy
- **SOX** – Financial reporting and internal controls
- **GLBA** – Data privacy for financial institutions
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – Security controls framework (used as a benchmark)

These frameworks influence how we manage user data, system security, access control, incident response, and third-party relationships.

## Control Mapping to Compliance Themes

| Compliance Theme         | Supporting Controls / Planned Enhancements                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Privacy             | Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Encryption at Rest and in Transit   |
| Access Control           | Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control    |
| Breach Notification      | IR plan, Legal & PR coordination, Pre-approved templates         |
| Vendor Risk Management   | Contract clauses, Auditing, Supply chain risk tiering           |
| Data Retention & Deletion| Data classification & lifecycle policy (planned)               |
| Employee Awareness       | Ongoing security training, phishing simulations                 |

---

## Recommendations for Compliance Maturity

- Conduct a formal **compliance gap analysis** against GDPR, CCPA, and other key standards
- Appoint a **Privacy & Compliance Officer** to coordinate legal reviews and audits
- Integrate compliance into **vendor onboarding and review processes**
- Maintain **audit logs and retention schedules** in alignment with legal retention laws
- Schedule **annual compliance reviews** to match regulatory update cycles

---

## Summary

While NovaCore’s NIST CSF roadmap lays a strong foundation, integrating compliance directly into our cybersecurity operations ensures we’re legally sound, customer-respectful, and audit-ready. Compliance should be treated as both a baseline requirement and a driver of customer trust and risk reduction.
